**Overview**

A turn-based, single-player deck-building strategy game consisting of short tactical battles where both sides act simultaneously. The game is set in 17th-century Europe, inspired by Sweden's era as a great power. Each battle has clear objectives and is not always won through total annihilation; sometimes retreat is the smartest strategy.

After each battle, rewards are distributed in the form of resources (experience points, gold, reinforcements) as well as "Honors and Entitlements"-diplomas, medals, promotions, memberships in orders, nobility titles, land grants, alliances, royal charters, and royal decrees. These can grant advantages but often come with some kind of drawback. Dialogue-based choices may occur between battles or during sieges, providing additional opportunities for agreements, alliances, or unexpected consequences.

Two primary playstyles are encouraged: direct military action or a more diplomatic and manipulative approach. Both should be valid paths to victory.

**Visual Style**

The illustration style blends children's book and comic aesthetics-imagine Tintin meets Elsa Beskow/Jan Lööf. Soft lines, pale watercolor tones, and top-down perspective. Historical atmosphere is prioritized over strict historical accuracy.

The visual style might lean more towards how the maps of the time (around 1630) looked. Usually made by copperplate engravings and hand-coloring.

**Difficulty**

- AI improvement is the primary method for increasing difficulty
- No "cheating AI" with hidden advantages
- Game balance is achieved through resource access and reinforcements

**GUI**

- Mouse-first interface with limited keyboard shortcuts
- Minimal scrolling, everything should fit on one screen
- Primarily top-down view, with optional orthographic perspective if time permits

**Game Structure**

The game consists of:

- Battles
- World Map (Navigation)
- Shops
- Rewards
- Encounters and Diplomatic Events

The game is won when the opponent runs out of resources at their headquarters. The same loss condition applies to the player.

**Battle**

Battles occur in rounds where the player uses cards based on available resource points in the "camp" (local), which are replenished from the "headquarters" each round. Cards cost resources, which are limited. If the camp is empty and no cards can be played, the player must flee.

**Victory Conditions May Include:**

- Hold a location for X rounds
- The side that loses the most resources loses
- No retreat allowed
- First to run out of camp points loses

**Unit Cards:**

- Played and become physical units on the map
- Have various stats: damage, range, accuracy, bonuses/penalties against certain enemy types
- Stats develop via experience points or Honors and Entitlements (not with gold)

**Terrain & Placement:**

- Terrain affects movement and combat outcome
- Units can interrupt each other's movement when they meet

**Retreat/Escape:**

- Retreat: controlled, few units lost
- Escape: chaotic, heavier losses and limited movement on the world map

**World map navigation**

Movement takes place on a strategic map consisting of:

- Fortresses, ports, cities, villages
- Fields, bridges, rivers, mountains
- Army positions and supply lines

**Shops**

- Purchase cards, resources, royal charters
- Remove cards for a fee
- Some Honors and Entitlements may be purchasable

**Rewards**

- Gold, experience points, Honors and Entitlements
- Amount depends on battle performance

**Encounters**

- Dialogue choices before/after battles or during sieges
- Offer opportunities for bonuses, Honors and Entitlements, or future consequences

**Cards (Unit Examples)**

- Musketeer
- Pikeman
- Light Cavalry
- Heavy Cavalry
- Artillery
- Grenadier
- Engineers

**Honors and Entitlements (with drawbacks)**

- Diplomas
- Medals
- Promotions
- Membership in Orders
- Nobility Titles
- Land Grants
- Alliances
- Royal Charters
- Royal Decrees

These provide benefits such as resources, troop bonuses, abilities, favorable trade deals, or new cards-but always carry potential drawbacks (e.g., loyalty obligations, debuffs, or obligations in future events).

**Note**

The term **Honors and Entitlements** is used as a collective name for commendations, titles, legal documents, and privileges.
