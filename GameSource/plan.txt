Separation

* Separate game logic from the Graphics.
* An object holds everything that's supposed to be "replayed" including sound and also silence.
* The players input is saved in an object and if the time is right the input is handled and an update is made in the object and the "replay" information is changed.
* When anything is supposed to happen it is placed in an event object that later the game logic will react to.
