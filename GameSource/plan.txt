Separation

* Separate game logic from the Graphics.
* An object holds everything that's supposed to be "replayed" including sound and also silence.
* The players input is saved in an object and if the time is right the input is handled and an update is made in the object and the "replay" information is changed.
* When anything is supposed to happen it is placed in an event object that later the game logic will react to.

* Resources can be in different positions: reinforcements, local base (camp), in battle (frontline).
* The resources in the different positions have a max sizes and a speed of transfer between the positions.
* When an unit dies that resource points are lost.
* If an unit survives the resorces Points from that unit are recovered.
* Retreat has to be possible and manytimes beneficial.
* A round has three stages: moving resources, the playing card stage and the fighting stage
