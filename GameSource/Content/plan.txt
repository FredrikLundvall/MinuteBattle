Separation

* Separate game logic from the Graphics.
* An object holds everything that's supposed to be "replayed" including sound and also silence.
* The players input is saved in an object and if the time is right the input is handled and an update is made in the object and the "replay" information is changed.
* When anything is supposed to happen it is placed in an event object that later the game logic will react to.


Quick round deck builder (Minute battle)
* Every battle have different win conditions.
* Win conditions can determine if retreat is possible or will be to costly.
* Xp gives possibility to upgrade the cards
* Xp is received by successfull skill checks (or failed skill checks) for example by missing an enemy.
* Gold is received by successfully achieving objectives.
* Gold is used to buy Resources or change the deck.
* Xp och gold can also be received in encounters.
* Resources is equal to hp, when they are reduced to zero it's game over.
* Resources can be in different positions: reinforcements, local base (camp), in battle (frontline).
* The resources in the different positions have a max sizes and a speed of transfer between the positions.
* When an unit dies that resource points are lost.
* If an unit survives the resorces Points from that unit are recovered.
* Retreat has to be possible and manytimes beneficial.
* A round has three stages: moving resources, the playing card stage and the fighting stage
* A stat on the cards is command strain. It adds to your players current strain and limits how many new cards or moves he can make.
* Sieges can be battles or encounters
* When choosing battles the strategy can be to attack enemy supply lines (speed of resources), 
  attack enemy camps (reduce local resources), eliminate forces (total resources). If you are forced to retreat, the damage is instead made to yourself

-- GODOT
Units should have different goals to simplify the enemy ai for the movements. 
Maybe some hardcoded places where they move to in the map. 
The placement of the canons is the base of the placement of the other units.
A list of places where canons is good to place can be a good start for the enemy ai development

The different terrains: 
road - move longer
forrest - move shorter, incomming projectile less accurate
river - unpassable 
bridge - adds a passable place on rivers
hill - expands outgoing projectile distance
swamp - move much shorter, unpassable for cannons and horses
buildings - can hold units?
